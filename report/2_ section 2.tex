        \subsubsection{Missing header row}
            The raw data set had no header row and thus a row was manually added with the respective attribute names in Microsoft Excel.
            
            After investigating, it was found that OpenRefine does not offer a simple way to insert a header row and thus Excel was used for insertion.
        \subsubsection{OpenRefine}
            OpenRefine offers multiple ways of inspecting and cleaning large amount of data through common transformations,
