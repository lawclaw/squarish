\section{Deliverable}\label{sec:deliverable}

The plan is to initially recreate the basic functionality of /r/place with its core elements.

\subsection{Features}\label{subsec:features}

The website's main functionality centers around the ability for users to view and modify squares on a single canvas.
The server (the Flask backend) handles the requests of the users as a central hub and using Websocket, transmits the changes on the board to everyone viewing.

Following is a list of core features (must-haves):

\begin{table}[!h]
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            Feature   & Description                                                  & Reason                                               \\ \hline
            Canvas    & Implement a pixel canvas that will display the current state & Main feature of the website                          \\ \hline
            Websocket & Using websocket protocol to allow for real-time updates      & Give users instant feedback on changes to the canvas \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    }
    \caption{Main features}
    \label{tab:mainFeatures}
\end{table}

\subsection{Additional features}\label{subsec:additional-features}

As for additional features (nice-to-haves), these could be considered once the main functions have been implemented.

\begin{table}[!h]
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            Feature      & Description                       & Reason                    \\ \hline
            Login system & System to track users             & Potential personalisation \\ \hline
            Timeout      & Restrict canvas editing frequency & Reduce bot behavior       \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    }
    \caption{Additional features}
    \label{tab:additionalFeatures}
\end{table}
