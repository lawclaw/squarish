\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

This coursework will discuss the recreation and potential enchancement of /r/place, a project made by Reddit, a discussion board website.

\subsection{What is /r/place}\label{subsec:what-is-/r/place}

/r/place was an event originally hosted by Reddit, a public discussion board website, on April Fools' Day in 2017 (April 1, 2017).

The event consisted of a website that hosted a 1000 x 1000 pixel grid where users were able to change the color of each square (refer to~\ref{fig:place2017}).
After editing a square, the user would be timed out for five minutes from changing another square.
The restriction was mainly to try to prevent bots on the canvas.

A very simple premise but as with any Internet phenomenon, the canvas quickly began to fill with many different figures, writings and Internet references.
Cooperation became vital due to the number of users on the platform and communities from the website gathered to create pixel art to represent their community on the canvas.

The site gained huge traction during its original 72-hour lifespan with many communities trying to out compete each other on the canvas.

/r/place has since been repeated twice, once on April 1, 2022, and once on July 20, 2023.

\subsection{Remakes}\label{subsec:remakes}

Since then clones and remakes of the website have been published.


Examples include  \url{https://rplace.live/} and \url{https://canv.tk/}
